# Chat-Application
## Chat app using websockets (Nodejs, Express &amp; Socket.io)
I have developed a chat application using express,Websockets.Though I could have used plain websockets but I used a library called Socket.io-which is wrapper around websockets,its super easy to use and provides a afallback to xhr requests until the websocket connecton is established.
### What is Websocket ?
WebSockets are an alternative to HTTP communication in Web Application, they offer full-duplex communication, that is, it is, bi-directional and that means the data can flow in both ways, so it can flow from client to the server and also from server to the client.
